### üöß[WIP]üöß
This app is using AWS, and it takes a lot of cost.</br>
Therefore I stop deploying this app now.</br>

And this is just for my skill proof.</br>
So I don't plan to use this app for business.</br>

### Other points I noticed during development

- The point which was conscious of team development<br>
We used pull requests on github to subdivide the feature implementation. <br>
- Single Page Application<br>
I used React.js for frontend and Ruby on Rails for backend.<br>
And I separated them.<br>
It makes this app readable.<br>
- Automatic deployment<br>
Implemented automatic deployment using Github Actions. <br>

## Background

There are two reasons for the development of this work. <br>
The first is that in recent years, due to the influence of the coronavirus, there have been fewer opportunities to go out, and more people have started exercising, such as home training, to alleviate the lack of exercise. <br>
In recent years, the number of sports gyms has increased and it has become easier to start exercising, but it takes time to see visible results, and many people get frustrated along the way. In order to do so, we created an social media type application that allows you to easily connect while sharing information. <br>
Second, I wanted to make it easier for people with muscle training experience to find a training method that suits them. <br>
It's been 4 years since I started muscle training myself, and for the first 3 years, I continued muscle training with reference to videos on the Internet, but I continued training that didn't suit my body, and I didn't do well. I couldn't put on muscle. <br>
However, I learned nutrition and training knowledge by myself, listened to people who have experience in muscle training on  social media, and practiced it for a year. I wanted to make it easy to find the method, so I created his  social media dedicated to muscle training.
